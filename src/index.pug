        h1 Why we are here
        .columns
          | At the beginning of every endeavour there is an idea, a vision of what you wish to accomplish.
          | It may not be obvious at first, but it is there, a force driving you forward. In our case this idea is to just <i>get going</i>
          | and assist others in doing the same. Personally, I find little as frustrating as getting stuck in a routine of
          | exhausting idleness. In retrospect it is clear to me that we founded KranCorp to combat this dizzying stagnation.
          | It has become a place of growth, of relentless trying and innovating, a playground for our ideas and ambitions.
          | And we are eager to share our passion and enjoyment with you - just look around and make yourself at home.

        h1 Our philosophy
        .columns
          | How do you write great software? How do you make sure you meet your own high standards, and what should be the mindset of your developers?
          | To us here at KranCorp the answer is simple: Programming is a craft,
          | fueled by the passion and devotion of those who exercise it. All our products are superb for all the same reason - because we believe in them,
          | because we pour all our heart and long-acquired knowledge into them. Our goal is not to produce a commodity, but to still a desire for perfection.
          | In the end it does not really matter if it was the stroke of a brush or a key that lead to the art of its result, and after all that is what we are striving for.

        h1 Also our philosophy
        | The Emperor – so they say – has sent to you, the subject, the wretched vassal, who is infinitesimal before
        | the Imperial Sun in the far distance, a scattered shadow, to you, just you, the Emperor has delivered a
        | deathbed message. He made his messenger to kneel at his bedside and whispered into his ear; so particular was
        | he, he asked that everything be repeated back into his own ear. With nods of his head he registered the rectitude
        | of the recitation. Before the audience of his death – all hindering walls had been torn down and, on the wide,
        | high, fanning staircase stood, in a ring, the lords of the land – before all of these he dispatched his messenger.
        | Immediately, he set out for the road. A robust, an indefatigable man, now with one arm and now with the other thrusting,
        | he cleared his path midst the throng. If met with resistance, he pointed to his chest, to the insignia of the Sun;
        | he moved easily then, the only one. But the crowd was so large, their ranks endless. Opening into wide fields,
        | how he might fly; doubtless soon you’d hear the rapturous rapping of his fists on your very door. Instead, though,
        | he struggles himself to exhaustion. Even still he squeezes through the castle’s innermost passages; he will never make it out.
        | And even if he succeeds, nothing will come of it. He must fight his way back down those stairs; and even if he succeeds,
        | nothing will be gained. There are the courtyards to traverse, and beyond them the second enclosure of the palace;
        | and still more stairs and courtyards; and still more palace walls; and so on for a millennium, until he finally
        | bursts through the outermost gate – but never, never will this happen – and there before him the royal seat,
        | the center of the world, poured completely under by sediment. None may penetrate here, not even with a dead man’s last words.
        | But you wait by your window, and dream of it when the evening comes.
